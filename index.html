    About Me!
  </h1>
  <h3 style="color:darkslategrey;">
    Hello, my name is Ashna Jain and I will be graduating from Northeastern University this May with a degree in Computer Science and Finance. 
    Throughout my time in college, I held multiple positions and served on the executive leadership board for a club called TAMID, an investment and consulting club. 
    I also completed two 6-month coops, one at Scotiabank doing fixed-income repo sales and trading and another at Amundi AM doing product management. 
    Post grad, I hope to find a job working in finance, hopefully in New York City. 
    Outside of school, I like to spend time outside when the weather is nice and play tennis or pickleball. I like going on walk on the esplanade and exploring new places in Boston.
    For spring break 2025, I traveled to Spain, specifically Barcelona and Madrid, and had a great time exploring the cities and trying new foods.
    The architecture there is very interesting and the cities are full of history. 
    I was born in Chicago but grew up in Texas, spending half my life in Houston and the other half in Dallas. 
    I have a younger sister who's in high school and when I'm home, I love going to coffee shops and playing volleyball with her.
