This .txt file will describe the styling and customizations I did for my website on part 1 of Homework 3.

- For coloring, I changed the page's background color as well as the font color of the title and description
- I put the contact information in its own paragraph, also with separate coloring
- For the contact information, I also changed the font type to be 'Courier New'
- For my email, I made the email address a clickable link that will prompt a new email draft
- I added a colored button to navigate to the second page
- For all of my photos, I added a caption to the figure

learnmore.html
- I created two columns for the photos so that it could be in a grid layout
